                        This is a digital exploration of Italo Calvino's <em>Invisible Cities</em>, a novel that describes 
                        fantastical cities through the conversations between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. It's one of my favorite texts of all time and I keep coming back to it and trying to recommend others to read it, or just send quotes of it. There's no good online compilation of the chapters that I found easily explorable, so I thought it'd be nice to have a link to send.

                        Each city represents different themes—memory, desire, signs, thin cities, trading cities, 
                        cities and eyes, cities and names, cities and the dead, cities and the sky, continuous cities, 
                        and hidden cities.

						<span style="font-style: italic">Note</span>: there is a lot of dialogue between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan in between chapters that aren't specific to a city which I have skipped over on this website.

                        <em>Invisible Cities</em> was first published in 1972. Calvino's work explores themes of 
                        urban planning, human experience, and the relationship between reality and imagination. 
                        The cities described are both physical places and metaphors for human conditions and desires. 
						From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities" class="text-gray-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline">Wikipedia</a>: Invisible Cities deconstructs an archetypal example of the travel literature genre, 
						The Travels of Marco Polo, which depicts the eponymous Venetian merchant's journey across Asia and 
						in Yuan China (Mongol Empire).
